# Test Cursor Positioning

This is a test file to verify cursor positioning functionality.

```lua
-- This is line 1 of the code block
local function test()
  print("This is line 3 of the code block")
  local x = 42
  if x > 0 then
    print("This is line 6 of the code block")
  end
end
```

Some text between code blocks.

```javascript
// This is line 1 of the JS code block  
function hello() {
  console.log("This is line 3 of JS block");
  const y = "test";
  return y;
}
```

End of test file.
